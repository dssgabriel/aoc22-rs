# Advent of Code 2022

## What is it all about?
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels 
that can be solved in any programming language you like.
People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, 
or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem 
solving skills will get you pretty far.
Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to [Share](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) it with others, 
or directly via PayPal or Coinbase.
